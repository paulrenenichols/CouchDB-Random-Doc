CouchDB-Random-Doc
==================

This project uses Node.js to create a CouchDB database, seed it with a specified number of documents, and randomly access those documents a specified number of times, incrementing an access count each time a document is accessed.

The goal of this project is two-fold.  The first reason I'm doing this project is to try out Node.js.  The second reason I'm doing this project is to analyze an algorithm for getting random documents from CouchDB.  I want to see how random that algortihm really is.
